1)Understand the Scenario
The train sounds its horn at point X.
An observer at point Y hears the sound.
The observer moves to point W at a constant speed a m/s for b seconds.

2)Determine Distances
Calculate the distance the observer travels to reach point W.
Use the speed a and time b to find the distance:
  \[
  \text{Distance} = a \times b
  \]

3) Calculate Sound Distance at W
The sound travels from X to W in two seconds.
Use the speed of sound (343 m/s) to find the distance:
  \[
  \text{Distance of sound in 2 seconds} = 343 \times 2
  \]

4) Determine Total Distance
The total distance d the sound travels from X to Y is the sum of the observer's distance to W and the sound's distance:
  \[
  \text{Total Distance} = \sqrt{(a\times b)^2 + (2\times 343)^2}
  \]

5) Calculate Time t
Use the total distance and the speed of sound to find the time it took for the sound to travel:
  \[
  t = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{343}
  \]
